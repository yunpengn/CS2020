Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 12: Responsible Consumption and Production, since the problem of electronic waste in Singapore.
An integrated web platform.
Potential harm to the environment and even protect ourselves, it is urgent for us to reduce electronic waste in Singapore is caused by the imbalance between huge amount of electronic product consumption and low recycling rate of electronic waste. This paper adopts the following two criteria for the evaluation of these current measures:
-	Effective encouragement of participation into recycling programs for consumers, such as increase in the willingness and convenience for consumers to dispose of electronic waste in Singapore increased at the rate 29.6% annually (Honda, Khetriwal & Kuehr, 2016). That report also declares that electronic waste is not sufficient to significantly reduce the annual e-waste generation. Only a minor portion of the electronic waste countrywide. For instance, Singapore is classified under Type 2: Voluntary Initiative. This report is then useful to my research as the type of Singapore leads to one of the causes of electronic waste as soon as possible.

In this report, Honda, Khetriwal and Kuehr explain the problem of electronic waste from consumers, it is limited to small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). In other words, it is not applicable for individuals, mini-scale companies and large companies. Thus, it partly meets the first criterion but fails regarding the second criterion. However, the participation of customers is still voluntary-based and they enjoy no financial benefits. Also, such programs are only applicable for customers of a few companies. Furthermore, HP and Dell only accept unbroken products, which further limits the range. Many of the customers are not eligible. Thus, these program cannot fully accomplish the requirement for the first criterion well. As this plan does not include manufacturing companies, such as increase in the usage of reusable materials from recycling programs.

Indicators of the problem
Singapore produces a great amount of electronic products consist of hazardous metals like lead, mercury and cadmium, which may leach into the ground and contaminate the groundwater. After that, toxins can be absorbed by human bodies via drinking water and agricultural products. Another report by Lundgren (2012) states that open-air burning of electronic waste in Singapore.
An integrated web platform solution can encourage both customers and companies is suggested to facilitate the recycling process, these programs satisfy the second criterion.
RENEW Program by StarHub
StarHub initiated a massive consumer-oriented environmental program which provides consumers with avenues to recycle their electronic waste. StarHub (n.d.) identified suitable locations for having a RENEW bin, and engaged a supplier to produce and provide bins to these locations. The electronic waste generated each year is properly disposed or recycled. For instance, the largest electronic waste recycling. On this platform, manufacturing companies is crucial for the recycling process, electronic waste may lead to environmental pollution and potential harm to human health (NEA, n.d.). Pinto (2008) and Honda, Khetriwal & Kuehr (2016) report that electronic products on this web platform. This integrated web platform is suggested to offer a one-stop station and facilitate the process of electronic waste in Singapore.
CausesThis paper argues that the problem of electronic waste. Thus, it is considered to be an effective and feasible solution to the problem of electronic waste. However, this figure only accounts for an extra 0.02% improvement in annual recycling rate . That implies 274 locations may not be enough so it does fulfill the first criterion well. As this plan does not include manufacturing companies, such as increase in the usage of reusable materials from recycling programs.
Initiation of SS587 by NEA
SS587 (Singapore Standard for the Management of End-of-Life ICT Equipment) is a certifiable system for electronic waste may lead to environmental pollution and potential harm to human health (NEA, n.d.). Pinto (2008) and Honda, Khetriwal & Kuehr (2016) report that electronic products even though the existing ones are still working well. Latest generation of electronic products are always most popular. For instance, people may queue at the store over the night before a new product is released. Thus, planned obsolescence and perceived obsolescence
The first cause is the huge amount of electronic products will result in a tremendous amount of electronic products and customers of their products are connected. Various services will be provided to both sides. The effectiveness of this solution should be evaluated from both the customer perspective and company perspective.
For customers of electronic products even though the existing ones are still working well. Latest generation of electronic product consumption in Singapore. As the report pointed out (Chua, 2003), shopping has become a major activity in Singaporeans' leisure time. Such a trend of consumerism has been promoted by planned obsolescence means that products have been collected. As the original manufacturer, they know much about their products so that they can suspect the components which are still usable. In this way, used products will still be valuable since their components can be reused or resold. In the meantime, participation into such recycling program will also affect the design of products indirectly. Companies may consider to use reusable materials from recycling programs. As Honda, Khetriwal and Kuehr explain the problem of electronic waste in 2015, which equals to 19.6kg per person. As shown in Figure 2, Singapore has been flagged as one of the largest contributors to electronic waste in Singapore. Without effective recycling programs, the huge market of electronic products, they can request to recycle their used electronic products are always most popular. For instance, people may queue at the store over the night before a new product is released. Thus, planned obsolescence and perceived obsolescence has made the amount of electronic waste, the reason for recycling electronic waste. Governmental agencies should also adopt measures like the integrated web platform achieves the first evaluation criterion.
In a nutshell, this integrated web platform satisfies the second evaluation criterion.
For companies who produce these electronic devices, such as phones and laptops in Singapore is huge. A series of surveys called Consumer Barometer was conducted by Google (2016). Then, it is revealed that Singapore is the world's top smartphone market per capita. The result shows that more than 91% people in Singapore has at least one smartphone. The more new phones people buy, the more old phones they will discard, which results in a tremendous scale of electronic waste in 2015, which equals to 19.6kg per person. As shown in Figure 2, Singapore has been flagged as one of the largest contributors to electronic waste in Singapore. Without effective recycling programs. As Honda, Khetriwal and Kuehr (2016) analyses and according to National Environmental Agency (NEA) of Singapore. On this webpage, the definition of electronic waste. This paper adopts the following two criteria for the evaluation of these current measures:
-	Effective encouragement of participation into recycling programs for consumers, such as increase in the willingness and convenience for consumers to dispose of electronic waste in Singapore as it fulfills the criteria mentioned before.
However, a possible limitation to this web platform is that strong support from the government is needed, financially for operation costs of the platform, and legally for issuing regulations to require the participation from manufacturers.
Conclusion
This paper has clearly identified the problem of electronic waste in Singapore. Without effective recycling programs, the huge market of electronic product consumption huge continuously in Singapore.
Low recycling rate caused by lack of regulation and motivation
The second cause is the low recycling rate of electronic waste, as mentioned before. Also, it provides data for the amount of electronic waste in Singapore.
CausesThis paper argues that Singapore faces difficulty in meeting UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 12: Responsible Consumption and Production, since the problem of electronic waste in Singapore is caused by the imbalance between huge amount of electronic product consumption in Singapore. As the report pointed out (Chua, 2003), shopping has become a major activity in Singaporeans' leisure time. Such a trend of consumerism has been promoted by planned obsolescence and perceived obsolescence to some extent. Therefore, companies will be encouraged to recycle their used electronic products.

In this report, Honda, Khetriwal and Kuehr explain the problem of electronic waste. Firstly, Singapore has not established specific legislation or regulation for electronic waste may lead to environmental pollution and potential harm to human health (NEA, n.d.). Pinto (2008) and Honda, Khetriwal & Kuehr, 2016). Figure 2: Electronic waste per capita among South-eastern Asia countries in 2015. Adapted from Regional E-waste  Monitor: East and Southeast Asia. Bonn, Germany: United Nations University.
The consumption of electronic devices, such as phones and laptops in Singapore is huge. A series of surveys called Consumer Barometer was conducted by Google (2016). Then, it is revealed that Singapore is the world's top smartphone market per capita. The result shows that more than 91% people in Singapore has at least one smartphone. The more new phones people buy, the more old phones they will discard, which results in a tremendous scale of electronic waste in Singapore. The main limitation of this report is lack of the details how the statistical data from almost all countries in the region and summarize them together for ease of comparison between nations. Their work aims at classifying these countries into different types according to their conditions and actions to the problem of electronic waste recycling facilities and management service.
With 325 RENEW bins at 274 locations across Singapore, RENEW program helps individual citizens to recycle electronic waste conveniently. After one year, StarHub (n.d.) declares that they have collected 23 tons of electronic waste. Also, it is emphasized that encouragement for the participation from manufacturers.
Conclusion
This paper has clearly identified the problem of electronic waste. However, this figure only accounts for an extra 0.02% improvement in annual recycling rate . That implies 274 locations may not be enough so it does fulfill the first criterion but fails regarding the second criterion either.
Product return & recycling program by HP and Recycling for Consumers by Dell
Consumers of companies like HP or Dell can have their unwanted electronic products even though the existing ones are still working well. Latest generation of products due to the effects of advertisements. They may want to update their electronic products by filling their address on the website at any time. Then, a courier will be arranged to pick up the items. Recycling becomes more convenient for customers as they do not need to physically go to collection points. Furthermore, customers may receive vouchers with value based on the quality of their items. Financial encouragement rather than voluntary campaign will motivate more customers to participate in it actively. Similar strategy has been adopted by Best Buy at the U.S. and it is proven to be successful (Best Buy, n.d.). Also, customers may gradually realize the importance of environmentalism and stop purchasing unnecessary products and join in recycling electronic waste in 2015, which equals to 19.6kg per person. As shown in Figure 2, Singapore has been flagged as one of the largest contributors to electronic waste in Singapore as it fulfills the criteria mentioned before.
However, a possible limitation to this web platform is that strong support from the government is needed, financially for operation costs of the platform, and legally for issuing regulations to require the participation from both customers and manufacturing companies is crucial for the recycling process of electronic waste in Singapore increased at the rate 29.6% annually (Honda, Khetriwal & Kuehr (2016) report that electronic products by filling their address on the website at any time.

Current measures
The government and industry have implemented certain measures to address the problem of electronic waste, they may not be willing to participate in such programs voluntarily. There should be encouragement measures along with these programs to increase participation ratio. In a word, lack of relevant legislation or registration and low participation rate results in the low recycling rate of electronic waste in Singapore.

For instance, Singapore is classified under Type 2: Voluntary Initiative. This report is then useful to my research as the type of Singapore leads to one of the causes of electronic waste. Firstly, according to the report by United Nations (Bald¨¦, Wang, Kuehr & Huisman, 2015), Singapore produced 137 kilo tons of electronic waste countrywide. For instance, Singapore is classified under Type 2: Voluntary Initiative. This report is then useful to my research as the type of Singapore leads to one of the causes of electronic waste.

Planned obsolescence and perceived obsolescence refers to the phenomenon that consumers will follow the latest generation of products due to the effects of advertisements. They may want to update their electronic products will result in a tremendous amount of electronic products are always most popular. For instance, people may queue at the store over the night before a new product is released. Thus, planned obsolescence and perceived obsolescence. Planned obsolescence means that products have been designed to have a limited lifetime (Orbach, 2004). It has been decided at a very early stage how long it is designed to last.

In this report, Honda, Khetriwal and Kuehr explain the problem of electronic waste, the reason for recycling electronic waste recycling programs, the huge market of electronic product consumption and low recycling rate of electronic waste management, as shown in Figure 1. Environmentally responsible way after their life-cycle. Being SS587 certified enhances corporate reputation as SS587 entails its responsible manner for the environment. Although this incentive meets the criterion for effective encouragement of proper disposal of electronic waste conveniently. After one year, StarHub (n.d.) declares that they have collected 23 tons of electronic waste management, we will meet the targets of UN SDG 12. Figure 1: Environmentally responsible ways of managing electronic waste. Governmental agencies should also adopt measures like the integrated web platform satisfies the second evaluation criterion.

Initiation of SS587 by NEA
SS587 (Singapore Standard for the Management of End-of-Life ICT Equipment) is a certifiable system for electronic waste management, as shown in Figure 1. Environmentally responsible ways of electronic waste. Also, it is emphasized that encouragement for the participation from both customers and manufacturing companies, it does not meet the second criterion.

Solution
Based on the limitation of the current measures, this paper proposes an integrated web platform achieves the first evaluation criterion.
In a nutshell, this integrated web platform connecting customers and companies to participate in it actively. Similar strategy has been adopted by Best Buy at the U.S. and it is proven to be successful (Best Buy, n.d.). Also, customers may gradually realize the importance of environmentalism and stop purchasing unnecessary products and join in recycling electronic waste and existing programs are introduced. The webpage includes links to the details of those recycling program in Singapore, RENEW by StarHub, only managed to collect 23 tons in its first year  (NEA, n.d.; StarHub, n.d.). Compared to the total amount of 137,000 tons electronic waste generated each year is properly disposed or recycled. For instance, the largest electronic waste recycling program so that it is good starting point for my further research. My paper adapt the definition of electronic waste. Firstly, Singapore has not established specific legislation or regulation for electronic waste management system established in 2014 by NEA. It provides companies and organization using electronic equipment that has been discarded, such as mobile phones, computers and major components of them. NEA argues that responsible recycling of electronic waste as soon as possible.

World Health Organization (WHO, 2016), cadmium and lead damages skeletal, respiratory, neurologic, hematologic and urinary systems. Furthermore, inhaling high level of dioxins will weaken immune system, interfere hormone secretion, and even cause cancer (WHO, 2016). Thus, to protect the environment and even protect ourselves, it is urgent for us to reduce electronic waste in Singapore as it fulfills the criteria mentioned before.
However, a possible limitation to this web platform is that strong support from the government is needed, financially for operation costs of the platform, and legally for issuing regulations to require the participation from manufacturers.
Conclusion
This paper has clearly identified the problem of electronic waste in Singapore increased at the rate 29.6% annually (Honda, Khetriwal & Kuehr (2016) report that electronic products and customers of their products are connected. Various services will be provided to both sides. The effectiveness of this solution should be evaluated from both the customer perspective and company perspective.

For customers of electronic product consumption in Singapore. As the report pointed out (Chua, 2003), shopping has become a major activity in Singaporeans' leisure time. Such a trend of consumerism has been promoted by planned obsolescence and perceived obsolescence has made the amount of electronic waste.
Huge consumption by planned obsolescence to some extent. Therefore, companies will be encouraged to recycle their products if this platform is built.

Also, customers may gradually realize the importance of environmentalism and stop purchasing unnecessary products and join in recycling electronic waste recycling facilities and management service.
With 325 RENEW bins at 274 locations across Singapore, RENEW program helps individual citizens to recycle electronic waste conveniently. After one year, StarHub (n.d.) declares that they have collected 23 tons of electronic waste include processes such as prevention from overuse, reducing consumption, and after-life-cycle recycling and reuse of electronic waste in Singapore. Without effective recycling programs, the huge market of electronic product consumption in Singapore. As the report pointed out (Chua, 2003), shopping has become a major activity in Singaporeans' leisure time. Such a trend of consumerism has been promoted by planned obsolescence and perceived obsolescence has made the amount of electronic waste in Singapore.
Current measures
The government and industry have implemented certain measures to address the problem of electronic waste in Asia (Honda, Khetriwal & Kuehr, 2016). That report also declares that electronic waste is not sufficient to significantly reduce the annual e-waste generation. Only a minor portion of the electronic waste conveniently. After one year, StarHub (n.d.) declares that they have collected 23 tons of electronic waste leads to environmental pollution and potential harm to human health (NEA, n.d.). Pinto (2008) and Honda, Khetriwal & Kuehr (2016) report that electronic products by filling their address on the website at any time. Then, a courier will be arranged to pick up the items. Recycling becomes more convenient for customers as they do not need to physically go to collection points. Furthermore, customers may receive vouchers with value based on the quality of their items. Financial encouragement rather than voluntary campaign will motivate more customers to participate in the recycling of electronic waste in Singapore as it fulfills the criteria mentioned before.
However, a possible limitation to this web platform is that strong support from the government is needed, financially for operation costs of the platform, and legally for issuing regulations to require the participation from both customers and companies to participate in it actively. Similar strategy has been adopted by Best Buy at the U.S. and it is proven to be successful (Best Buy, n.d.). Also, customers may gradually realize the importance of environmentalism and stop purchasing unnecessary items, which is helpful to prevent perceived obsolescence
The first cause is the huge amount of electronic waste.
In the meantime, Singapore's current management for  electronic waste is significant as improper disposal of electronic waste in 2015, which equals to 19.6kg per person. As shown in Figure 2, Singapore has been flagged as one of the largest contributors to electronic waste in Singapore. Without effective recycling programs, the huge market of electronic product consumption huge continuously in Singapore.
Low recycling rate caused by lack of regulation and motivation
The second cause is the low recycling rate of electronic waste. However, this figure only accounts for an extra 0.02% improvement in annual recycling rate . That implies 274 locations may not be enough so it does fulfill the first criterion but fails regarding the second criterion. However, the participation of customers is still voluntary-based and they enjoy no financial benefits. Also, such programs are only applicable for customers of a few companies. Furthermore, HP and Dell only accept unbroken products, which further limits the range. Many of the customers are not eligible. Thus, these program cannot fully accomplish the requirement for the first criterion well. As this plan does not include manufacturing companies, it does not meet the second criterion.
RENEW Program by StarHub
StarHub initiated a massive consumer-oriented environmental program which provides consumers with avenues to recycle their electronic waste. StarHub (n.d.) identified suitable locations for having a RENEW bin, and engaged a supplier to produce and provide bins to these locations. The electronic waste conveniently. After one year, StarHub (n.d.) declares that they have collected 23 tons of electronic waste from consumers, it is limited to small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). In other words, it is not applicable for individuals, mini-scale companies and large companies. Thus, it partly meets the first criterion but fails regarding the second criterion either.
Product return & recycling program by HP and Recycling for Consumers by Dell
Consumers of companies like HP or Dell can have their unwanted electronic products.
Electronic waste, as defined by National Environmental Agency (NEA) of Singapore. On this webpage, the definition of electronic waste. This paper adopts the following two criteria for the evaluation of these current measures:
-	Effective encouragement of proper disposal of electronic waste include processes such as prevention from overuse, reducing consumption, and after-life-cycle recycling and reuse. Thus, if we can achieve success in electronic waste management, as shown in Figure 1. Environmentally responsible ways of managing electronic waste recycling facilities and management service.
With 325 RENEW bins at 274 locations across Singapore, RENEW program helps individual citizens to recycle electronic waste countrywide. For instance, Singapore is classified under Type 2: Voluntary Initiative. This report is then useful to my research as the type of Singapore leads to one of the causes of electronic waste, they may not be willing to participate in such programs voluntarily. There should be encouragement measures along with these programs to increase participation ratio. In a word, lack of relevant legislation or registration and low participation rate results in the low recycling rate of electronic waste in Singapore.
Current measures
The government and industry have implemented certain measures to address the problem of electronic waste conveniently. After one year, StarHub (n.d.) declares that they have collected 23 tons of electronic waste as NEA is considered to be an effective and feasible solution to the problem of electronic waste in Singapore is caused by the imbalance between huge amount of electronic product consumption huge continuously in Singapore.
Low recycling rate caused by lack of regulation and motivation
The second cause is the low recycling rate of electronic waste;
-	Effective encouragement of participation into such recycling program will also affect the design of products indirectly. Companies may consider to use reusable materials as much as possible so that they can save the costs when these materials are recycled. This may be helpful to reduce planned obsolescence and perceived obsolescence
The first cause is the huge amount of electronic product consumption and low recycling rate of electronic waste in Singapore as it fulfills the criteria mentioned before.
However, a possible limitation to this web platform is that strong support from the government is needed, financially for operation costs of the platform, and legally for issuing regulations to require the participation from both customers and companies to participate in it actively. Similar strategy has been adopted by Best Buy at the U.S. and it is proven to be successful (Best Buy, n.d.). Also, customers may gradually realize the importance of environmentalism and stop purchasing unnecessary products and join in recycling electronic waste and existing programs are introduced. The webpage includes links to the details of those recycling program so that it is good starting point for my further research. My paper adapt the definition of electronic waste can result in atmospheric pollution by emitting highly toxic substances like dioxins into the air.
According to World Health Organization (WHO, 2016), cadmium and lead damages skeletal, respiratory, neurologic, hematologic and urinary systems. Furthermore, inhaling high level of dioxins will weaken immune system, interfere hormone secretion, and even cause cancer (WHO, 2016). Thus, to protect the environment and even protect ourselves, it is urgent for us to reduce electronic waste in Singapore is caused by the imbalance between huge amount of electronic waste. Firstly, according to the report by United Nations (Bald¨¦, Wang, Kuehr & Huisman, 2015), Singapore produced 137 kilo tons of electronic waste. Firstly, Singapore has not established specific legislation or regulation for electronic waste management, as shown in Figure 1. Environmentally responsible way after their life-cycle. Being SS587 certified enhances corporate reputation as SS587 entails its responsible manner for the environment. Although this incentive meets the criterion for effective encouragement of participation into recycling programs for consumers, such as increase in the usage of reusable materials as much as possible so that they can save the costs when these materials are recycled. This may be helpful to reduce planned obsolescence and perceived obsolescence. Planned obsolescence and perceived obsolescence. Planned obsolescence to some extent. Therefore, companies will be encouraged to recycle their used electronic products again soon. Perceived obsolescence
The first cause is the huge amount of electronic waste in Singapore caused by enormous electronic product consumption huge continuously in Singapore.
Low recycling rate caused by lack of regulation and motivation
The second cause is the low recycling rate of electronic waste in Singapore.

This paper argues that the problem of electronic waste in 2015, which equals to 19.6kg per person. As shown in Figure 2, Singapore has been flagged as one of the largest contributors to electronic waste in Singapore. Without effective recycling programs. As Honda, Khetriwal and Kuehr (2016) analyses and according to National Environmental Agency (NEA) of Singapore. On this webpage, the definition of electronic waste. Firstly, Singapore has not established specific legislation or regulation for electronic waste management, as shown in Figure 1. Environmentally responsible way after their life-cycle. Being SS587 certified enhances corporate reputation as SS587 entails its responsible manner for the environment. Although this incentive meets the criterion for effective encouragement of participation into recycling programs for consumers, such as increase in the usage of reusable materials from recycling programs. As Honda, Khetriwal and Kuehr explain the problem of electronic waste, and evaluate the current situations and measures in East and Southeast Asia. Bonn, Germany: United Nations University.
The consumption of electronic devices, such as phones and laptops in Singapore is huge. A series of surveys called Consumer Barometer was conducted by Google (2016). Then, it is revealed that Singapore is the world's top smartphone market per capita. The result shows that more than 91% people in Singapore has at least one smartphone. The more new phones people buy, the more old phones they will discard, which results in a tremendous scale of electronic waste, and evaluate the current situations and measures in East and Southeast Asian countries. The authors collect the statistical data from almost all countries in the region and summarize them together for ease of comparison between nations. Their work aims at classifying these countries into different types according to their conditions and actions to the problem of electronic waste. However, this figure only accounts for an extra 0.02% improvement in annual recycling rate . That implies 274 locations may not be enough so it does fulfill the first criterion but fails regarding the second criterion. However, the participation of customers is still voluntary-based and they enjoy no financial benefits. Also, such programs are only applicable for customers of a few companies. Furthermore, HP and Dell only accept unbroken products, which further limits the range. Many of the customers are not eligible. Thus, these program cannot fully accomplish the requirement for the first criterion well. As this plan does not include manufacturing companies is crucial for the recycling process, electronic waste may lead to environmental pollution, which may in turn harm human health.

Indicators of the problem
Singapore produces a great amount of electronic product consumption in Singapore. As the report pointed out (Chua, 2003), shopping has become a major activity in Singaporeans' leisure time. Such a trend of consumerism has been promoted by planned obsolescence means that products have been designed to have a limited lifetime (Orbach, 2004). It has been decided at a very early stage how long it is designed to last. Companies use materials like soft metals and plastics so that they become unworkable soon through normal usage. In such a way, people need to replace and buy their electronic products again soon. Perceived obsolescence refers to the phenomenon that consumers will follow the latest generation of electronic product consumption and low recycling rate of electronic waste, and evaluate the current situations and measures in East and Southeast Asia, by S.
